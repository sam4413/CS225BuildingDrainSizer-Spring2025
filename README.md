## INTRODUCTION:  
This project will have a strong emphasis on real world applications. The goal of this project and in extension this program is to be at least capable of aiding engineers in calculating the total drainage fixture units value of a building. Calculating this value by itself is a complicated process, especially if the given project involves many fixtures of many types which can take hours if there is a large building being designed. This program aims to save the hassle of calculating hundreds of fixtures and give the engineer or designer an easy-to-use utility tool to aid in calculating this value. 

This program is designed to assist designers and engineers in accurately calculating the total Drainage Fixture Units (DFU) for each building, calculating the values with respect & compliance with the Florida Plumbing Code (1). By automating the calculation of these values, the program simplifies the timely process of determining the appropriate main sanitary/sewer drainage size based on regulatory guidelines. The program will also incorporate a saving / loading system to allow portability between devices and allow engineers to save their current progress as the design process for buildings in general can take months, if not years. The program will help streamline the overall plumbing system design, improve efficiency, and ensure proper drainage capacity for various types of buildings.
